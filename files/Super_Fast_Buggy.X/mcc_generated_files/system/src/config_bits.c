// Configuration bits: selected in the GUI

//CONFIG1
#pragma config FEXTOSC = ECH    // FEXTOSC External Oscillator mode Selection bits->EC (external clock) above 8 MHz
#pragma config RSTOSC = HFINT32    // Power-up default value for COSC bits->HFINTOSC with 2x PLL (32MHz)
#pragma config CLKOUTEN = OFF    // Clock Out Enable bit->CLKOUT function is disabled; I/O or oscillator function on OSC2
#pragma config CSWEN = ON    // Clock Switch Enable bit->Writing to NOSC and NDIV is allowed
#pragma config FCMEN = ON    // Fail-Safe Clock Monitor Enable->Fail-Safe Clock Monitor is enabled
